            <p>Ibadan is the capital and most populous city of Oyo State, in Nigeria. It is the
                third-largest city by population in Nigeria after Lagos and Kano, with a total
                population of 3,649,000 as of 2021, and over 6 million people within its
                metropolitan area. It is the country's largest city by geographical area. At the
                time of Nigeria's independence in 1960, Ibadan was the largest and most populous
                city in the country, and the second most populous in Africa behind Cairo.
                Ibadan is located in south-western Nigeria, 128 kilometres inland northeast of Lagos
                and 530 kilometres southwest of Abuja, the federal capital. It is a prominent
                transit point between the coastal region and areas in the hinterland of the country.
                Ibadan had been the administrative centre of the old Western Region since the early
                days of British colonial rule, and parts of the city's ancient protective walls
                still stand to this day. The principal inhabitants of the city are the Yoruba
                people, as well as various communities from other parts of the country.</p>

            <p>Ibadan, capital city of Oyo state, Nigeria, located on seven hills (average elevation 700 feet [200 metres]) about 100 miles (160 km) from the Atlantic coast. It is one of the most populous cities in the country.
            Ibadan‚Äôs beginnings are shrouded in mystery; they were recorded only in oral tradition. It is said that the earliest group of settlers at Ibadan were fugitives from justice who were expelled from nearby villages. This small group later swelled with the arrival of immigrants from all over Yorubaland (now western Nigeria).</p>

            <p>The economic activities of Ibadan include agriculture, commerce, handicrafts, manufacturing, and service industries. Although the city‚Äôs farming population has declined, it is still large for an urban area. Many cultivators are part-time farmers who augment their earnings with other work.
            Ibadan is an important commercial centre. Virtually every street and corner in the traditional core and the inner suburbs of the city is a market square or stall. Within the city there are many markets. The largest daily market stretches in a belt from the railway station in the west to the centre of the city and is Ibadan‚Äôs commercial core.</p>

            <p>Some local crafts still flourish. These include weaving, spinning and dyeing, pottery making, and blacksmithing. The adire (‚Äútie-dye‚Äù) cloth dyed locally in large pots of indigo is popular. The small businesses in the city engage in corn milling, leather working, wood and steel furniture making, printing, photography, hotel management, and motor and other repairing. There are, however, few modern manufacturing industries.Ibadan is well served by roads. The city has a fleet of privately owned taxicabs and minibuses, and regular bus services are operated within the city and its suburbs.</p>

            Of the city‚Äôs parks, the most important is Agodi Park and Gardens. There are also zoological and botanical gardens, two main stadiums, and a large number of athletic facilities. Pop. (2007 est.) 2,628,000; (2016 est.) urban agglom., 3,160,000.</p>
