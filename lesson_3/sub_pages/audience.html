        <p class="content_1">The target audience for this website are mainly visitors who are new to
            the city of
            Ibadan this website would be a guide for them and would make their visit a delight.
            Having everything they need here on the website like where to do laundry, swim, buy
            varieties of food, and so on would prevent them from falling prey to scams and also help
            them avoid frustrations.
            Another group that is being targeted are those that recently moved into town. relocating
            can be quite challenging especially when you have heard so much about a city but now
            here you are, where do you start from. You have only heard about the fancy soccer
            stadium but can't find where to get your usual groceries. Such an individual is among
            our targetted audience</p>
