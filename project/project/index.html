    <meta name="description" content="Bountiful Foods is small business specializing in organic, locally grown foods. They are physically located in Carlsbad, California, however, they have many food trucks that cover the coastal area from Los Angeles to San Diego. The company sells fruits and produce directly from the farmers in the area, but also uses some national and international suppliers. The owner-operated company caters to walk in traffic at their storefront in Carlsbad and, of course, their food trucks. They deliver and manage those orders on the phone and via the website. The mission is to provide fresh and healthy food options, including organic, made to order, fruit drinks and fruit bags, to the local population and to tourists visiting the coastal areas. The theme should support healthy eating, organic bounty, and convenience.">

            <p class="para">One of the best pieces of advice I've ever got! Kitchen makeover (includes your fridge and pantry) is essential if you want to eat healthily. No matter how much self-control you have, if you have unhealthy food stashed in your fridge or kitchen cabinets, you will end up eating it. So, toss out the unhealthy foods and re-stock with healthy foods.</p>

            <p class="para">The California South Coast region extends from Ventura County to the Mexican Border and includes the counties of Los Angeles, Orange and San Diego. It is known for its sandy beaches, surf-able waves, moderate climate, and large and diverse population. The region is defined by the coastal plains of several major rivers and is bounded by the Transverse Mountain Ranges that include the Santa Monica and Santa Susana Mountains. The south coast of California has extremely high levels of species diversity, many of which are unique to the region, and the greatest number of threatened and endangered species in the state.</p>

            <p class="para">Love fruits? It's the perfect time to indulge and make the most of nature's sweet offerings by shaking up spectacular juices at home. Loaded with essential minerals and fiber, fruits can work wonders to energise and refresh you in the scorching heat. And you needn't stick to plain old mono-flavoured juices reminiscent of packaged varieties to enjoy them. Go all out and shake up a spectacular range of fresh fruit juices by mixing and matching, and using herbs and spices to spruce things up a little.</p>
